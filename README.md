   The app fetches news, weather, and stock data from external APIs using HTTP requests. API keys are loaded from a .env file for security.
2. **State Management:**  
   Uses the [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) package for managing bookmarks and app-wide state.
3. **Navigation:**  
   Implements both bottom navigation and in-app navigation for a seamless user experience.
4. **Customization:**  
   Users can filter news by country and category, bookmark articles, and view detailed weather and stock info.
